# Swift Bloc

Hello, welcome to Swift BloC.

This is an organization on Github that houses repositories maintained by our team. In addition, you can visit our repositories at:

- [Bloc](https://www.github.com/swift-bloc/bloc)
- [SwiftUIBloc](https://www.github.com/swift-bloc/swiftui-bloc)

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swift-bloc) and in each repository through the README.md file.

## Our Objective

Our goal is to simplify and streamline the presentation layer coding process by leveraging the declarative programming paradigm. The smoothness that Flutter Bloc brings to app implementation has inspired us to port this powerful framework to SwiftUI.

We are constantly implementing new features, exploring what the community is currently using, and following the [BLoC](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) standards.

Moreover, we greatly value your contribution to making Swift Bloc even better. Feel free to open an issue, discuss an idea, implement a new feature, or simply have a chat with the community.

## Platforms

Bloc is supported on all Apple platforms.
